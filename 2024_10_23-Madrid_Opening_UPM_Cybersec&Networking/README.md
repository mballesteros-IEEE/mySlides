# Conference

Opening talk to new students at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid.

I had the honor of giving the opening talk to the 320 new students at Telecommunication Students at Campus Sur ETSIST - UPM. I shared the amazing work we do at Siemens Gamesa and how we focus on strengthening cybersecurity every day, especially within the PPC team and ICS team, which plays a key role in our value chain.

I provided an overview of cybersecurity in operational technologies and critical infrastructures, where industrial automation and control meet digitalization and hyperconnectivity, creating efficient processes and improving quality.

I also shared some stories from my time at university and highlighted the importance of being part of engineering associations, both during studies and throughout a professional career.

It was a pleasure to talk about networking, from an international association like IEEE to a local association with a promising future like AMGITT (Asociación Madrileña de Graduados e Ingenieros Técnicos de Telecomunicación).
