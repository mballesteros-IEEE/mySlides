*Title: Professional Activities and Young Professionals R8* a.k.a. Professional Development

Summary: You are a member of the IEEE and technically a phenomenon, we know that, but ... how can we help boost your professional career?

The industrial and service sectors await your knowledge, but you are young, inexperienced and somewhat confused. We talk about the keys to achieving it: creativity, motivation, leadership and entrepreneurial spirit with the clear objective of making a difference career.
